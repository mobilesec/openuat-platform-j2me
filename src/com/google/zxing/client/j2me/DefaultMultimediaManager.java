/**

 * may support, like setting focus and zoom. This implementation itself will do nothing.
 * It will attempt to dynamically instantiate {@link com.google.zxing.client.j2me.AdvancedMultimediaManager}
 * which has methods that call JSR-234 APIs to actually set focus, zoom, etc. If successful,
 * this class will delegate to that implementation. But if the phone does not support these
 * APIs, instantiation will simply fail and this implementation will do nothing.</p>
